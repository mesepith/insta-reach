## ðŸ›  How It Works

1. The extension checks if you are on `https://www.instagram.com/explore/people/`.
2. If not, it prompts you to visit the correct page.
3. Once on the page, clicking the **Follow** button in the extension will:
   - Click on 10 "Follow" buttons one by one.
   - Repeat the process until all users on the page are followed.
   - Show a message: `You have followed everyone on this page. Refreshing the page...`.
   - Refresh the page with a new list of users to follow.
4. The user can then click the **Follow** button in the extension again to repeat the process.

## ðŸ“¢ Status Messages
The extension provides real-time status messages in the popup:

- **If the user is on the wrong page:**
  - "Visit this link: [Instagram Explore People](https://www.instagram.com/explore/people/) and then click on the Follow button above."
- **During follow process:**
  - "X people followed."
  - "Follow limit of 10 reached."
- **If all users on the page are followed:**
  - "You have followed everyone on this page. Refreshing the page..."
